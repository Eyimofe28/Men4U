# Men4U

## Project Overview

This project is a SwiftUI application designed to help students know what meals will be served next in their school's cafeterias. The app includes several key features such as filtering meal options, user authentication, and profile management.

## Features

1. **Home Page**: Displays the meal options available in the cafeteria. Users can see all meal options or filter them based on preferences.

2. **Filter Page**: Allows users to filter meal options based on meal types, dietary restrictions, and allergies.

3. **Profile Page**: Users can manage their profile information, including updating their profile picture, adjusting appearance settings, and accessing help information.

4. **Login and Sign-Up Pages**: Users can create a new account or log in to an existing one. The sign-up page prompts for essential details such as first name, last name, email, and password.

5. **Forgot Password Page**: Helps users recover their account by resetting their password.
